# My private and work related slides

To use my slides install go's present tooling by running:

```sh
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present@latest
```

Then change to the slide directory and run:

```sh
present
```

and find the slides under:

`http://127.0.0.1:3999`

To build your own slides, have a look at present's documentation:
